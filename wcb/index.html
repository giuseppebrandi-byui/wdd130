            <p class="info-description">
              According to Approved Index, a staggering number of UK SMEs with
              no website are losing billions of pounds in revenue annually. In
              fact, there are 1,98 million SMEs without an online presence,
              causing the economy to lose £343 billion a year. In contrast, it
              has been estimated that introducing a website for a business may
              generate an uplift in turnover of £173,769 on average.

              Why is it so important to have a website?
            </h3>
            <p class="info-description">
              In a survey conducted by Weebly, 56% of respondents said that they
              did not trust companies that didn't have a website. Since
              consumers consult websites before making a purchase decision, it
              is critical to have a website that represents your business and
              builds your credibility. This is not rocket science. However,
              there are other reasons why having an online presence can benefit
              your business. In general, a website can help you reach more
              people and provide information that is useful to your prospects as
              they learn more about your products or services. It is then easier
              to convert these prospects into buyers. In addition to being an
              excellent marketing tool, a website can also save you money in the
              long run because traditional advertising methods can be costly.

              Is Facebook enough for my business?

            <p class="info-description">
              In our experience, if you are a small home cake bakery business or
              a local handyman, you can operate solely from a Facebook page or
              any other forms of social media. We know people who are doing
              decently well without a dedicated website; however, can't you
              imagine how much more rewarding it would be to be in control of
              how the public perceives your company? By having your own website,
              you have complete control over the design, layout, logo, and
              branding without being restricted by the social media platform you
              choose. Investing in a website is a wise decision, and if you are
              a start-up with limited capital, you can always start small and
              add additional features as the business grows. Remember, with us
              you are in control of your website.
