        <strong>What is the cost of not having a website for your business?</strong><br>
        According to Approved Index, a staggering number of UK SMEs with no website are losing billions of pounds in revenue annually. In fact, there are 1,98 million SMEs without an online presence, causing the economy to lose £343 billion a year. In contrast, it has been estimated that introducing a website for a business may generate an uplift in turnover of £173,769 on average. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Why is it so important to have a website?</strong><br>
        In a survey conducted by Weebly, 56% of respondents said that they did not trust companies that didn’t have a website. Since consumers consult websites before making a purchase decision, it is critical to have a website that represents your business and builds your credibility. This is not rocket science. However, there are other reasons why having an online presence can benefit your business. In general, a website can help you reach more people and provide information that is useful to your prospects as they learn more about your products or services. It is then easier to convert these prospects into buyers. In addition to being an excellent marketing tool, a website can also save you money in the long run because traditional advertising methods can be costly.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What about Facebook?</strong><br>
        In our experience, if you are a small home cake bakery business or a local handyman, you can operate solely from a Facebook page or any other forms of social media. We know people who are doing decently well without a dedicated website; however, can’t you imagine how much more rewarding it would be to be in control of how the public perceives your company? By having your own website, you have complete control over the design, layout, logo, and branding without being restricted by the social media platform you choose. Investing in a website is a wise decision, and if you are a start-up with limited capital, you can always start small and add additional features as the business grows. Remember, with us you are in control of your website.
