          <h3>Main Fork of the Salmon River</h3>
          <p>
            The Salmon is one of the longest undammed rivers in the United
            States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and
            colder in the early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late
            summer.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are good rapids all summer...but families with children who
            like to swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer
            water more.
          </p>
          <p>The rapids in the Salmon are technically rated Class I-IV.</p>

          <h3>Desolation and Gray Canyon</h3>
          <p>
            Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most
            desolate land anywhere, the Green river flows towards the mighty
            Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert
            scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous.
          </p>
          <p>
            This 84-mile trip runs from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just
            outside Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery,
            interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and
            historic human activity, and great whitewater opportunities.

          <h3>Grand Canyon, Arizona</h3>
          <p>
            Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with
            breathtaking scenery to make one truly unforgettable river
            experience. The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating
            whitewater rapids, but with side canyons and ancient indian ruins
            accessible only by river.
          </p>
          <p>
            CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The
            rapids in the Canyon are technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to
            accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances.
            However, most people are familiar with the regular I - V river
            rating scale, so we often refer to both.
